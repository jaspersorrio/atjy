Other than that, every kid was also given a Mac Donaldsâ€™ meal each for their dinner which they enjoyed incredibly!</p><p>Seeing the kids enjoying themselves made me really happy as well! The time seemed to have passed really fast when I was with them. I love the presence of kids and they never fail to remind me to enjoy the little things in life!</p>",

We spent almost two weeks there where we helped out with the refurbishment of the child care in the village which includes building of toilets and extensions of classrooms. In addition to the construction works, we also had the chance to interact with the kids in the village where we conducted a few English lessons for them!</p><p>The 2 weeks spent there was an extremely draining one, but the experience I got in return was definitely unmeasurable. It has truly opened my eyes to the other part of the world. My greatest takeaway of this trip would definitely be the spirit of the villagers there. Even though many of them did not have much for themselves, they were still very contented and happy with the life they had. Despite of their tight financials, many of the villagers there would still generously offer us the food they had. Truly, the happiest people do not necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the best of everything they have!</p>",

Other than that, we also conducted a salad making workshop for them where we taught them how to make a simple salad and emphasized the importance of healthy living to them!</p><p>Most of these kids came from complicated family backgrounds. Their parents either left them or no longer have the ability to take care of them, so they had to be send to the centre where the organisation will take care of them until they grow up.</p><p>The visit to the centre made me realize how fortunate I am to be able to have my family with me by my side, supporting me in whatever I do. I never realize what a great blessing it is, until I saw the kids who do not have their parents with them even at such a young age. Through the interaction with the kids, I also learnt that even though they may not have their parents there to love them, we can be the one loving them! Afterall, how much does loving others cost?

It was my first time participating in a distribution drive then.</p><p>Throughout the event, I got to interact with many residents. They actually shared with me about the circumstances that they were in, the helplessness they felt given their financial situations. Many of them were also relying on government social support as they could not work due to their illnesses. It was definitely heart-wrenching to hear them sharing all these to me.</p><p>Through the interactions with these residents, I began to learn that although Singapore is a well-developed country, there are still a minority of people who are suffering behind the closed door which not many of us know of.
